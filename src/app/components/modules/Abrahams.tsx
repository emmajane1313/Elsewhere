            Working-class Jewish immigrants from London found their footing in
            the leather and shoe trades. The earliest threads of a colonial
            fashion industry down under. An explained connection to Michael
            Hyam, the London born bootmaker and community elder who offered both
            soles and blessings. A trade connection, a cultural anchor. And
            under Hyamâ€™s authority, Abraham marries Rachel at the Five Islands.

            A later life mystery. A some point, a disappearance from the Sydney
            records. Rachel remains listed alone in the directories for decades.
            A re-recorded name from Abraham to Joseph. Maybe he died between
            births and directories. Maybe he stepped out and never returned. A
            silence sewn into the ancestry line.
